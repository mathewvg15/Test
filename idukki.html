          <h1>IDUKKI</h1><br>
          <br>
          
            <p> Idukki is one of the 14 districts of Kerala state, India, created on 26 January 1972.
                 This beautiful High range district of Kerala is geographically known for its Mountainous
                  Hills and Dense Forests. For the people of Kerala, Idukki is always associated with Power
                   Generation. About 66% of the Stateâ€™s Power needs come from the Hydroelectric Power Projects
                    in Idukki.
                Idukki which lies in the Western Ghats of Kerala is the second largest district in area but has
                 the lowest population density. Idukki has a vast forest reserve area; more than a half of
                  the district is covered by forests. The urban areas are densely populated whereas villages
                   are sparsely populated. Idukki is also known as the spice garden of Kerala.</p>
