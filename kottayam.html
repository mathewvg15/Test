          <br>
          
            <p>Kottayam is a city in the Indian state of Kerala. It is located in central Kerala and is also the 
                administrative capital of Kottayam district. Bordered by the lofty and mighty Western Ghats on the
                 east and the Vembanad Lake and paddy fields of Kuttanad on the west, Kottayam is a land of unique
                  characteristics. Panoramic backwater stretches, lush paddy fields, highlands, hills and hillocks,
                   extensive rubber plantations, places associated with many legends and a totally literate people 
                   have given Kottayam District the enviable title: The land of letters, legends, latex and lakes. 
                   The city is an important trading center of spices and commercial crops, especially rubber. Most
                    of India’s natural rubber originates from the acres of well-kept plantations of Kottayam, also 
                    home to the Rubber Board. Kottayam is also called as “Akshara Nagari” which means the “city of 
                    letters” considering its contribution to print media and literature.</p>
