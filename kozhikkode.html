          <br>
          
            <p>Kozhikode is a town with a long recorded history. From time immemorial, the city has attracted 
                travellers with its prosperity. It has traded in spices like black pepper and cardamom with 
                Jews, Arabs, Phoenicians, and Chinese for more than 500 years. As Kozhikode offered full 
                freedom and security, the Arab and the Chinese merchants preferred it to all other ports.
                 Kozhikode was the capital of Malabar during the time of Sri Samoothiri Maharajas, who ruled
                  the region before the British took over. The cityâ€™s first recorded contact with Europe was
                   when Vasco da Gama docked at Kappad (18 km north) in May 1498, among the leaders of a trade 
                   ssion from Portugal. He was received by Sri Samoothiri Maharaja himself. Kozhikode and its 
                   suburbs formed part of the Polanad kingdom ruled by the Porlatiri. The Eradis of Nediyirippu 
                   in Eranad wanted an outlet to the sea, to initiate trade and commerce with the distant lands
                    and after fighting with the king Polatthiri for 48 years conquered the area around
